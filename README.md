# Maze generator & path finding
Random perfect maze generation using Recursive-Backtracker-Algorithm and finding shortest path using Breadth-First-Algorithm written in C++ and Qt QGraphicsView Framework

## Algorithms
Generation - [Recursive Backtracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_implementation)<br />
Solving - [Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
